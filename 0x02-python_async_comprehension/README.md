# Asynchronous Comprehension in Python

## Overview
This project explores advanced asynchronous programming concepts in Python, focusing on asynchronous generators and comprehensions. It demonstrates the power and efficiency of these techniques in handling concurrent operations.

## Key Concepts
- Asynchronous Generators
- Async Comprehensions
- Parallel Execution with `asyncio.gather()`
- Runtime Measurement of Asynchronous Operations

## Project Structure
1. `0-async_generator.py`: Implements an asynchronous generator yielding random numbers.
2. `1-async_comprehension.py`: Utilizes async comprehension to collect results from the generator.
3. `2-measure_runtime.py`: Measures the runtime of parallel async comprehensions.

## Technical Highlights
- Leverages `asyncio` for managing asynchronous code.
- Implements type hinting for improved code readability and maintainability.
- Demonstrates efficient parallel execution of asynchronous tasks.

## Usage
Each module can be run independently to demonstrate its functionality. Use the provided main files to test each component.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- No external libraries required beyond Python's standard library.

## Note
This project is designed to showcase advanced asynchronous programming techniques in Python. It's ideal for developers looking to deepen their understanding of async/await syntax and parallel execution in Python.
